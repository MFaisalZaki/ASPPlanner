# ASPPlanners

A lightweight planner that solves automated planning problems by compiling them to Answer Set Programming (ASP) and delegating search to [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/). ASPPlanners plugs into the [Unified Planning](https://github.com/aiplan4eu/unified-planning) (UP) framework as a `OneshotPlanner` engine, so any UP problem can be solved through a uniform interface.

Two backends share the same UP front-end (compilation pipeline, map-back, validation) and register as UP engines on import:

| engine | encoding | solver |
|---|---|---|
| `PLASPPlanner` (default) | PLASP-style multi-valued ASP, multi-shot over the horizon | [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) |
| `ABAPlanner` (optional) | STRIPS-to-ABA (assumption-based argumentation) reduction | [aspforaba](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/aspforaba) |

Both are **satisficing** planners: iterative deepening stops at the first horizon that admits a plan, and reports `SOLVED_SATISFICING`. Because the horizon grows one step at a time, the plan returned is shortest *in number of steps*, but no quality metric (`total-cost`, `total-time`) is optimised — metrics are accepted and ignored.

# 1. Installation and quick usage

## Requirements

Python 3.10+. Runtime dependencies are installed automatically: `clingo>=5.6.0`, `unified-planning>=1.1.0`, `up_fast_downward>=0.5.2`.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MFaisalZaki/ASPPlanners.git
cd ASPPlanners
pip install -e .
```

The `ABAPlanner` backend additionally needs `aspforaba`; install it with the optional `aba` extra:

```bash
pip install -e ".[aba]"
```

It is imported lazily, so `import aspplanners` and the default `PLASPPlanner` engine work without it.

## Quick usage

### Through the Unified Planning framework

Importing `aspplanners` registers the engine, so the standard UP entry points work out of the box:

```python
import aspplanners  # registers the PLASPPlanner and ABAPlanner engines
from unified_planning.shortcuts import OneshotPlanner

# `problem` is any unified_planning.model.Problem you constructed or parsed.
with OneshotPlanner(name="PLASPPlanner") as planner:
    result = planner.solve(problem, timeout=60)
    print(result.status)   # SOLVED_SATISFICING
    print(result.plan)     # move(l1, l2)
```

From PDDL files:

```python
from unified_planning.io import PDDLReader
from unified_planning.shortcuts import OneshotPlanner
import aspplanners

problem = PDDLReader().parse_problem("gripper/domain.pddl", "gripper/prob01.pddl")
with OneshotPlanner(name="PLASPPlanner") as planner:
    print(planner.solve(problem, timeout=60).plan)
```

### Direct API

You can also drive the planner directly if you don't need the UP result wrapper:

```python
from aspplanners.plasp.planner import PLASPPlanner

planner = PLASPPlanner(problem, encoder_type="seq")
plan = planner.plan(max_horizon=100, timeout=60)   # or plan(horizon=10)
print(planner.status)   # PlanGenerationResultStatus of the last call
print(planner.logs)     # human-readable notes
print(planner.layers)   # ('core', 'numeric') — the encoding layers this task needs
```

`plan()` returns a `SequentialPlan` — or a `TimeTriggeredPlan` when the task has durative actions. It is empty when no plan was found (check `planner.status`) — or when the goal already holds in the initial state, in which case `status` is `SOLVED_SATISFICING`.

### Engine options

| option | engine | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_horizon` | both | 1000 | upper bound on the iterative-deepening search |
| `horizon` | both | — | solve at one fixed horizon instead of deepening |
| `time_scale` | both | 10 | resolution of the temporal encoding, see [`time_scale`](#time_scale) |
| `encoder_type` | PLASP | `"seq"` | encoding family |
| `semantics` | ABA | `"ST"` | aspforaba extension semantics |
| `timeout` | PLASP only | — | honored by `PLASPPlanner`; **`ABAPlanner` ignores it**, so bound its search with `max_horizon` |

```python
with OneshotPlanner(name="PLASPPlanner", params={"max_horizon": 50}) as planner:
    ...
```

### Refusals

Both engines refuse tasks they cannot encode, and a refusal is part of the result rather than an exception that escapes it:

```python
result = planner.solve(problem)
if result.status == PlanGenerationResultStatus.UNSUPPORTED_PROBLEM:
    print(result.log_messages[0].message)   # ... cannot encode this task: <why>
```

`supported_kind()` answers for the task's *declared* features and is deliberately broad. Two things it cannot see also mean "outside this engine's fragment", and all three arrive the same way:

| refused | when | example |
|---|---|---|
| the `ProblemKind` is outside `supported_kind()` | before encoding | a feature the backend does not implement |
| the encoder reads the task and declines a shape | encoding time | a product of two fluents the task writes; an effect reading its own target with a fractional coefficient |
| clingo cannot represent the program the encoding built | grounding time | a `#sum` whose weights leave the signed 32-bit range |

The third is why this is a status and not a pre-flight check: the encoding states a numeric comparison as a difference `#sum` over the *reachable values* of its fluents, so on a task whose fluents declare no bounds there is nothing in the task to check against — the limit is only visible once clingo grounds it. `aspplanners.common.errors.UnsupportedTaskError` is the type these raise internally; it subclasses `NotImplementedError`, so code written against the older convention of catching that still works.

### Inspecting the generated logic program

```python
text = planner.lp_program()          # task facts + multi-shot encoding, verbatim
planner.dump_lp_program("task.lp")   # same, written to a file

terms = planner.encoding_terms()     # encoding parsed into ASPTerm statements
print(planner.encoding_paths)        # the .lp files loaded, in load order
```

`encoding_terms()` returns typed statements (`ASPFact`, `ASPRule`, `ASPConstraint`, `ASPWeakConstraint`, `ASPDirective`) wrapping clingo AST nodes — filter or rewrite them programmatically, then write them back out:

```python
from aspplanners.lp_io import parse_lp_file, dump_lp, ASPRule

terms = parse_lp_file("my-encoding.lp")
rules = [t for t in terms if isinstance(t, ASPRule)]
dump_lp(terms, "normalized.lp")   # also accepts fact-builder terms and plain strings
```

The encoding is split into `#program base / step(t) / check(t)` parts; ground `base` + `step(1..h)` + `check(h)` and set the external `query(h)` to true to solve at horizon `h`.

The authoritative list is `supported_kind()` in [aspplanners/up_engines.py](aspplanners/up_engines.py), in UP `ProblemKind` terms:

| `ProblemKind` feature | PLASP | ABA |
|---|---|---|
| `ACTION_BASED`, `FLAT_TYPING`, `HIERARCHICAL_TYPING`, `BOUNDED_TYPES` | ✅ | ✅ |

| `TIMED_EFFECTS`, `TIMED_GOALS`, `PROCESSES`, `EVENTS`, `SELF_OVERLAPPING`, `INTERMEDIATE_CONDITIONS_AND_EFFECTS`, `OVERSUBSCRIPTION` | ❌ | ❌ |

A task outside the declared kind is refused up front with `UNSUPPORTED_PROBLEM` rather than silently mis-encoded. `ProblemKind` cannot express every distinction, so a few shapes are raised at *encoding* time instead, as `NotImplementedError`:

- a product of two numeric fluents the task **writes** (not linear in the state; a product with a *static* factor is linear and is encoded, see [Numeric planning](#numeric-planning)),
- division by a numeric fluent,
- an effect that reads **its own target** with a fractional coefficient (`(assign (v ?b) (+ … (* 0.9 (v ?b))))`) — no scaling reaches it, since the target's own factor cancels,
- a numeric value needing a scale factor past `MAX_NUMERIC_SCALE`,
- a bounded numeric type on a fluent that needs scaling,
- a numeric over-all condition in a durative action (**ABA backend only**).

`GENERAL_NUMERIC_PLANNING` is declared because an effect that merely *reads* a fluent already pushes a task's kind there, and the feature has no linear/non-linear split.

## Customizing the compilation pipeline

Pass `compilationlist` to take over the choice entirely. Each entry is a `[engine_name, CompilationKind]` pair applied in order, and the list is used verbatim — the automatic grounder selection is bypassed, so include or omit the grounder yourself:

```python
from unified_planning.shortcuts import CompilationKind
from aspplanners.plasp.planner import PLASPPlanner

# Solve on the lifted encoding: run the removers but skip the grounder.
pipeline = [
    ["up_quantifiers_remover",            CompilationKind.QUANTIFIERS_REMOVING],
    ["up_negative_conditions_remover",    CompilationKind.NEGATIVE_CONDITIONS_REMOVING],
    ["up_disjunctive_conditions_remover", CompilationKind.DISJUNCTIVE_CONDITIONS_REMOVING],
]
planner = PLASPPlanner(problem, encoder_type="seq", compilationlist=pipeline)
plan = planner.plan()
```

## Encoding layers

The encoding is one `.lp` file per feature, under [aspplanners/plasp/encodings/seq/](aspplanners/plasp/encodings/seq/):

| Layer | File | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | [core.lp](aspplanners/plasp/encodings/seq/core.lp) | multi-valued STRIPS over the horizon: the action choice, preconditions, (conditional) effects, add-wins arbitration, inertia, the goal test |
| `numeric` | [numeric.lp](aspplanners/plasp/encodings/seq/numeric.lp) | linear numeric fluents, comparisons, effects (conditional ones included) and goals |
| `disjunctive` | [disjunctive.lp](aspplanners/plasp/encodings/seq/disjunctive.lp) | disjunctive, existential and nested conditions and goals |
| `temporal` | [temporal.lp](aspplanners/plasp/encodings/seq/temporal.lp) | PDDL 2.1 durative actions as SMTPlan-style happenings, annotated with the SMTPlan constraint each rule mirrors |

clingo merges `#program` parts of the same name across the files it is given, so the program for a task is the concatenation of the layers it needs, loaded in dependency order (`core` first — it declares the program parts and the `query(t)` external). Layers reference each other's predicates only through `#defined`, which is what lets one be left out without breaking the rest.

**Layers are chosen per task, and you do not normally pick them.** `encoder_type="seq"` infers them from the facts the encoder emitted, widened by what the compiled problem's `ProblemKind` reports:

```python
planner = PLASPPlanner(problem, encoder_type="seq")
planner.layers          # ('core', 'numeric', 'temporal')
planner.encoding_paths  # the .lp files that will be loaded, in load order
```

The emitted facts are the authority — they describe the task *as encoded*, after the compilation pipeline, TIM inference, numeric rescaling and the durative split. `ProblemKind` is a second opinion only: it reports declared features rather than the vocabulary the encoding consumes, and the two need not agree (a durative action whose duration reads a fluent produces numeric facts on a problem whose kind has no numeric feature at all). Where they differ, the union wins — an unneeded layer grounds to nothing, while a missing one would be silently ignored.
