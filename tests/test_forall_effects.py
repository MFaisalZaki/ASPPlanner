"""``forall`` effects: the ADL shape the encoding expands in the grounder.

A ``forall`` effect is not compiled away, on the same terms as a ``forall``
*condition*: its variables are emitted free and the grounder ranges them over
the universe. The load-bearing part is that a *conditional* one is one effect
per binding -- the encoding's ``caused/3`` fires an effect only when every
``precondition`` of its effect term holds, so the term has to carry the
bindings. Sharing one term across them would encode a different task: "fire
when every object satisfies the condition" instead of "fire for each object
that does".

The behavioural tests below are all stated as goals a wrong reading cannot
reach, and every plan is validated against the original problem by UP's
validator, which expands the quantifier independently of this encoder.
