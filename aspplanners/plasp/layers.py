"""Encoding layers: which ``.lp`` files make up the program for a given task.

The sequential-horizon encoding is split into one file per feature (see
``encodings/seq/``). clingo merges ``#program`` parts of the same name across the
files handed to it, so the program for a task is simply the concatenation of the
layers it needs; a layer that is left out is not an error, because layers refer
to each other's predicates only through ``#defined``.

That last property is also the hazard. Leaving out a layer a task *does* need is
silently wrong rather than loud: drop the numeric layer from a numeric task and
its ``numPrecondition`` facts sit there constraining nothing, and clingo returns
a plan that does not respect them. So selection is driven by what the encoder
actually emitted, and :meth:`EncodingFamily.check_coverage` turns "a fact nobody
consumes" into an exception at construction time instead of a mysterious
validation failure several horizons later.

Two independent signals pick the layers:

  * the **fact predicates** the encoder emitted (:func:`fact_predicates`). This
    is the authority. It is exact by construction -- a layer is needed iff some
    fact only it reads is present -- and it describes the task as encoded, after
    the compilation pipeline, TIM inference, numeric rescaling and the durative
    split have all had their say.
  * the **problem kind** (:meth:`EncodingFamily.layers_from_kind`), read off the
    *compiled* problem. This is advisory. It cannot be authoritative because it
    describes the task's declared features rather than the vocabulary the
    encoding consumes, and the two need not line up: a feature can be compiled
    away, and a feature can be absent while the encoder still emits the facts
    (a durative action's over-all comparison produces ``numOverall`` whether or
    not the task otherwise counts as numeric).

The default takes their union. Over-selecting costs a few unused rules that
ground to nothing; under-selecting costs correctness, so the two signals
disagreeing is resolved in favour of loading more.
